“So son how is school going?”
a) Jesus Christ granddad I finished school years ago, I even finished university?! DID YOU BACK TO NAM?! 
b) Sorry grandad I am 22 years old..I work now.
c) *You don’t have to heart to say to him that you’re not in high school anymore* It's going fine thanks. *You now thinks you are 12 and go to school.*
