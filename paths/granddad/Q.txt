You see your granddad, sitting alone in the corner. You have not spoken to him since you left for university. You approach him to talk to him. He looks at you with a blank expression on his face. He stares for a second and says “Back in the nam...”
a) Granddad I just came over to say hi, I don’t have time to hear another one of your god damn war story.
b) YOU DON’T KNOW MAN, YOU WEREN'T THERE!
c) *You sigh as you mentally prepare yourself for another war story*
