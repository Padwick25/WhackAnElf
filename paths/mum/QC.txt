Well you're my lovely son anyway I'm glad you're here regardless...So have you been seeing anyone while galavanting around Media City?
a) No mother, I thoroughly enjoy my work far too much to focus on such trivial things, I have spent my bursary on a hooker pool party though so I have got some.
b) Get money, get bitches...I have no money…. Thus no bitches. Anyway i'm a lone wolf AWOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
c) Me and my partner are very nicely acquainted, would you like to meet her?
