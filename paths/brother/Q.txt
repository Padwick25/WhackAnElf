Your little 9-year-old brother is staring at you across the table, he scrunches up his face entering his known bratty mode, you know he’s dying to say something so you ask him, “What’s up man you look a little off?” He responds, “I can’t believe you got a Nintendo Switch for Christmas, all I got was the new iPhone 12, you suck!”
a) As always you’ve been an ungrateful brother, you should read the Communist Manifesto.
b) Unfortunate for you! I’m the favourite in this family, you’re just an annoying spoilt brat!
c) We are brothers, take it easy big man we can always share.
