“I wish you were nicer; you’ve always been a shit brother to me. I haven’t forgotten about when you forced me to do the splits and ripped my gooch and nuts…I hate you and always have! Why do I need to have you as an older brother, this sucks!”
a) It does suck, and sucks just as much to have you as a brother
b) Fuck you.
c) Have the Switch, have it all, I’m not that bothered. I hope It makes up for what trauma I    put you through.
