Hmph…don’t think I’ll be sharing with you too much though, only a little! Your brother unscrunches his bratty face before speaking again, “I haven’t forgotten about when you forced me to do the splits and ripped my gooch and nuts…life will never be the same”
a) I thought all youngsters were flexible, you coulda been the next best gymnast! Truly sorry though I don’t think that’ll be happening!
b) Your right life will never be the same, you can say you can do the splits now!
c) What’s your point, you’re my little bellend brother, you deserved it as far as I’m concerned.
